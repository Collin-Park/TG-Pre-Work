## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

First, the web browser converts the web address into an address which is searchable on the internet. This process is done through searching cache locally or through the Domain Name Server (DNS) which has a set of registries that can match the website to the correct internet protocol (IP) address.

Once the IP address is retrieved, the clients browser sends (through the internet service provider) a packet of data to the IP address which is likely associated with the servers that host the website for techtonicgroup.

Once the packet is received by the host servers, the packet data is verified and the files associated with the webpage is sent back to the clients browser. These files are things like HTML, JS and CSS. Once these files are retrieved, these files are rendered by the browser for the client to interact with.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

The data retrieved by the browser may take several forms. They are mostly comprised of html, CSS and JS.

HTML:
In every scenario, there is an html file which contains the html markup. html markup is written with a high level of sophistication in the rules of what contains what, also known as the document object model. A tree like structure can be formed using the various tags and by nesting the tags appropriately to partition the elements in ways we want to manipulate.

CSS:
Once the DOM tree is constructed, styles are overlaid onto it. Cascading Style Sheets is a stylized sheet language which overlays visuals (aesthetics as well as spacial control) onto the html markup. The stylesheet follows the basic syntax of seeking a selector inside the html markup and making a declaration of a property that will be specified as well as a value it should take. CSS follows the basic mechanism of specificity as a rule for determining which declaration is dominant.

CSS is crucial to a webpage, how the webpage is displayed will ultimately determine the impact the webpage will have in attaining its goal.
