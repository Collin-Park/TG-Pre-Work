<!--good coding practice is to write legible code with good commenting,
the browser completely ignores whitespace between the elements, so it is a good
idea to take advantage of the whitespace and minimize confusion for clients who
may need to work on the code in the future. also, the ready at the end of the text
should probably be read.-->
