<!--this module will teach us to make tabular data.
the first thing i noticed was the .css api called to change the font,
another css file was called to create the table
the banner has an image and unordered list of which the first is 'active'
the table follows, it follows the system where the first row is the table header
thead, followed by tbody, the first column of every row is also a th and the rest
of are td. -->
