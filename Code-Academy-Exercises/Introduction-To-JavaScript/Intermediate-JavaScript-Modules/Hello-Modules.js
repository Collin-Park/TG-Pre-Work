/*
modules are files in JS which contain reusable pieces of code. these can be used to:
1. find, fix, and debug code more easily;
2. reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of our application;
3. keep information private and protected from other modules;
4. and, importantly, prevent pollution of the global namespace and potential naming collisions,
by cautiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program.
