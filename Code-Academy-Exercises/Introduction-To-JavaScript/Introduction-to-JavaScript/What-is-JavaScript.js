//Javascript is a programming language for web development.
// the way i understand it, html provides the skeleton and contents of what's to
// be displayed, CSS is a stylesheet that improves on user access and then
// there's JS which is the programming side that is able to bring complex
// functionability to our web browsing experience, I can't wait to get started!
