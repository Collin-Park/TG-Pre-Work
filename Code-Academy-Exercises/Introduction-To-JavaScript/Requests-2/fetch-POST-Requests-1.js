just as we have used fetch to get the response,
we can use fetch to post data. the conditions
for sending data in the body is stringent and
must be json.stringified.

the code is split into 4 parts,
the part which sends the request,
the part which converts the code to json,
the part which handles errors,
and the part which handles success.

we'll be using rebrandly to study post.
