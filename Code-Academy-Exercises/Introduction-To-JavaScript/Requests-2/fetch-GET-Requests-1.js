/*
fetch is similar to XMLHttpRequest but is more
powerful and flexible.
a fetch returns a promise, which is an object
that can help with scheduling asynchronous tasks.


a fetch:
1. Creates a request object that contains relevant
information that an API needs.
2. Sends that request object to the API endpoint
provided.
3. Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to
a response object, which contains the status of
the promise with information the API sent back.

the next exercise will deal with creating a boiler
plate code for the fetch request.
