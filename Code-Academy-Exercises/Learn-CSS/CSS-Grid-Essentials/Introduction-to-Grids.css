/* so far we have learned the box model, the flexbox (is this the border-box?)
and CSS display and positioning. on top of the three we've learned so far, there is
a fourth set of properties that use a grid format and can boost our ability to
improve layout.
the properties learned will be:
1. grid-template-columns
2. grid-template-rows
3. grid-template
4. grid-template-area
5. grid-gap
6. grid-row-start / grid-row-end
7. grid-column-start / grid-column-end
8. grid-area
