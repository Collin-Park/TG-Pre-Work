/*
repeat(arg1, arg2) is a function that takes in two arguments arg1 and arg2
arg1 is an integer that repeats arg2 arg1 number of times.
arg2 is the thing we want to repeat.
repeat() could be constructed with a for loop that loops arg1 number of times
printing out arg2 concatenated with a space to get this result.
