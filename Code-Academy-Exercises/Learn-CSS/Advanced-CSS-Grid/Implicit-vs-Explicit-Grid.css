/*in all our exercises so far we've been using explicitly defined numbers of rows
and columns in our grids. sometimes there may be more elements than can fit perfectly
into the rows and columns, for example let's say that i search for light bulbs on amazon
and ask to display 100 search results, lets say that only 89 results show up,
Inside CSS is is an implicit grid algorithm which fills the grids from rows on down.
I'm sure there are ways to change how the automation and rules play out.*/
